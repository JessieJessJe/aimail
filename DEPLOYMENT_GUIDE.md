# üöÄ Newsly Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Newsly application to production using Vercel, the recommended platform for Next.js applications.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ‚úÖ Environment Variables Setup
Before deploying, ensure your environment variables are properly configured:

1. **Database Configuration**
   - Your PostgreSQL database should be accessible from the internet
   - Update `DATABASE_URL` in production environment

2. **Email Configuration** 
   - `EMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail address
   - `EMAIL_PASS`: Gmail app password (not your regular password)
   - `EMAIL_FROM`: The "from" address for outgoing emails

3. **API Keys**
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Claude API key for AI responses
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Generate a secure secret for authentication
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your production domain URL

### ‚úÖ Code Preparation
1. Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
2. Test the build locally: `npm run build`
3. Commit all changes to your Git repository

## üåê Deployment Options

2. **Import Your Repository**
   - Click "New Project" on Vercel dashboard
   - Import your `newsly` repository from GitHub
   - Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In project settings, add all your environment variables:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
     EMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
